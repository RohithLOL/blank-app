With climate change causing temperature fluctuations, this can result in skewed populations with more females or more males, which affects the turtle population's ability to reproduce effectively.")

Additionally, turtles serve as prey for other animals, supporting biodiversity. For instance, green sea turtles feed on seagrass, preventing it from growing excessively and suffocating itself. Preserving turtle populations is essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems.")
